# GrainCube

The Graincube is a fun little project that allows you to play a granular synthesizer with a Gamecube controller. Most of the work for this project went into the physical interface that deals with decoding controller protocol so that it can be read by Max. The interface could theoretically be configured to control anything in one's computer via USB. 

A detailed project report is available here: https://paulodenwaldtdigitalelectronics.wordpress.com/2017/12/14/the-graincube/

I owe a big thanks to Nico (github.com/NicoHood), from whom I borrowed source code to get going on controller interpretation. To get this project working you must install his Nintendo library which can be found on his GitHub. Again, thanks Nico!

Feel free to email me any questions or comments and please help yourself to this project/code.
